Module 3 Cheat Sheet - Introduction to Shell Scripting
Bash shebang
1
#!/bin/bash
Copied!
Get the path to a command
1
which bash
Copied!
Pipes, filters, and chaining
Chain filter commands together using the pipe operator:
1
ls | sort -r
Copied!
Pipe the output of manual page for ls to head to display the first 20 lines:
1
man ls | head -20
Copied!
Use a pipeline to extract a column of names from a csv and drop duplicate names:
1
cut -d "," -f1 names.csv | sort | uniq
Copied!
Working with shell and environment variables:
List all shell variables:
1
set
Copied!
Define a shell variable called my_planet and assign value Earth to it:
1
my_planet=Earth
Copied!
Display value of a shell variable:
1
echo $my_planet
Copied!
Reading user input into a shell variable at the command line:
1
read first_name
Copied!
Tip: Whatever text string you enter after running this command gets stored as the value of the variable first_name.

List all environment variables:
1
env
Copied!
Environment vars: define/extend variable scope to child processes:
1
2
export my_planet
export my_galaxy='Milky Way'
Copied!
Metacharacters
Comments #:
1
# The shell will not respond to this message
Copied!
Command separator ;:
1
echo 'here are some files and folders'; ls
Copied!
File name expansion wildcard *:
1
ls *.json
Copied!
Single character wildcard ?:
1
ls file_2021-06-??.json
Copied!
Quoting
Single quotes '' - interpret literally:
1
echo 'My home directory can be accessed by entering: echo $HOME'
Copied!
Double quotes "" - interpret literally, but evaluate metacharacters:
1
echo "My home directory is $HOME"
Copied!
Backslash \ - escape metacharacter interpretation:
1
echo "This dollar sign should render: \$"
Copied!
I/O Redirection
Redirect output to file and overwrite any existing content:
1
echo 'Write this text to file x' > x
Copied!
Append output to file:
1
echo 'Add this line to file x' >> x
Copied!
Redirect standard error to file:
1
bad_command_1 2> error.log
Copied!
Append standard error to file:
1
bad_command_2 2>> error.log
Copied!
Redirect file contents to standard input:
1
$ tr “[a-z]” “[A-Z]” < a_text_file.txt
Copied!
The input redirection above is equivalent to:
1
$cat a_text_file.txt | tr “[a-z]” “[A-Z]”
Copied!
Command Substitution
Capture output of a command and echo its value:
1
2
THE_PRESENT=$(date)
echo "There is no time like $THE_PRESENT"
Copied!
Capture output of a command and echo its value:
1
echo "There is no time like $(date)"
Copied!
Command line arguments
1
./My_Bash_Script.sh arg1 arg2 arg3
Copied!
Batch vs. concurrent modes
Run commands sequentially:
1
start=$(date); ./MyBigScript.sh ; end=$(date)
Copied!
Run commands in parallel:
1
./ETL_chunk_one_on_these_nodes.sh  & ./ETL_chunk_two_on_those_nodes.sh
Copied!
Scheduling jobs with cron
Open crontab editor:
1
crontab -e
Copied!
Job scheduling syntax:
1
m  h  dom  mon  dow   command
Copied!
(minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week)

Tip: You can use the * wildcard to mean "any".

Append the date/time to a file every Sunday at 6:15 pm:
1
15 18 * * 0 date >> sundays.txt
Copied!
Run a shell script on the first minute of the first day of each month:
1
1  0 1 * * ./My_Shell_Script.sh
Copied!
Back up your home directory every Monday at 3:00 am:
1
0 3 * * 1  tar -cvf my_backup_path\my_archive.tar.gz $HOME\
Copied!
Deploy your cron job:
Close the crontab editor and save the file.

List all cron jobs:
1
crontab -l
Copied!
Conditionals
if-then-else syntax:
1
2
3
4
5
6
if [[ $# == 2 ]]
then
  echo "number of arguments is equal to 2"
else
  echo "number of arguments is not equal to 2"
fi
Copied!
'and' operator &&:
1
if [ condition1 ] && [ condition2 ]
Copied!
'or' operator ||:
1
if [ condition1 ] || [ condition2 ]
Copied!
Logical operators
Operator	Definition
==	is equal to
!=	is not equal to
<	is less than
>	is greater than
<=	is less than or equal to
>=	is greater than or equal to
Arithmetic calculations
Integer arithmetic notation:
1
$(())
Copied!
Basic arithmetic operators:
Symbol	Operation
+	addition
-	subtraction
*	multiplication
/	division
Display the result of adding 3 and 2:
1
echo $((3+2))
Copied!
Negate a number:
1
echo $((-1*-2))
Copied!
Arrays
Declare an array that contains items 1, 2, "three", "four", and 5:
1
my_array=(1 2 "three" "four" 5)
Copied!
Add an item to your array:
1
2
my_array+="six"
my_array+=7
Copied!
Declare an array and load it with lines of text from a file:
1
my_array=($(echo $(cat column.txt)))
Copied!
for loops
Use a for loop to iterate over values from 1 to 5:
1
2
3
for i in {0..5}; do
    echo "this is iteration number $i"
done
Copied!
Use a for loop to print all items in an array:
1
2
3
for item in ${my_array[@]}; do
  echo $item
done
Copied!
Use array indexing within a for loop, assuming the array has seven elements:
1
2
3
for i in {0..6}; do
    echo ${my_array[$i]}
done
Copied!
