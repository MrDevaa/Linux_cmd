Change the current directory to a subdirectory:
1
cd child_directory_name
Copied!
Tip: Because cd looks in the current directory for child_directory_name, you donâ€™t need to type the entire path.

Change the current directory:
Up one level: cd ../

To home: cd ~ or cd

To some other directory: cd path_to_directory

Change the current directory to another one at the same level:
Suppose you have two sibling directories within the same directory, dir_1 and dir_2, and your present working directory is dir_1. To switch to dir_2, enter:

cd ../dir_2

Tip: Using .., you don't need to know the path to the parent directory to switch to a sibling.

Change the current directory back to the directory you were in previously:
cd -
